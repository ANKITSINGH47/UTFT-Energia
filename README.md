# UTFT-Energia

This is [Energia](https://github.com/energia/Energia) port of the Henning Karlsen's [UTFT library](http://henningkarlsen.com/electronics/library.php?id=52).
Currently it is meant for [custom MSP430FR5739](https://github.com/andresv/industrial-switcher/tree/master/hardware/pcb) based board. However with simple modifications it can be ported to Fraunchpad, Launchpad and other boards that are able to use Energia.

Tips about porting it to different platforms can be found [here](http://andres.svbtle.com/how-to-add-energia-support-to-utft-library).
